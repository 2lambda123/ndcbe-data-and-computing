# Welcome to (Advanced) Data and Computing for Engineers

Data and computing skills are essential to all subdomains of modern (chemical) engineering, yet many students only receive ad-hoc training in these topics. Instead, **CBE 20258** (undergraudate) and **CBE 60258** (graduate) provides a systematic and rigorous introduction to the fundamentals of i) computing in Python; ii) mathematical modeling; iii) numerical methods for equation solving, integration, and optimization; iv) probability and statistics; and v) data analytics.
