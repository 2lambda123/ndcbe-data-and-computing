# Semester Project

## Introduction

In teams of two, you will create and revise teaching material (e.g., class examples, assignments) that use numerical methods and data analysis skills from CBE 60258. These material will be targetted at undergraduate or graduate science and engineering students.

Deliverables:
1. Either (1) individually revise a published numerical methods contributed notebook or (2) with your partner, create a new notebook.
2. With your partner, prepare a new notebook that teaches one or more data analysis topics from CBE 60258 using a science or engineering example.
3. With your partner, give a 7-minute presentation that summarizes your contributions to the class website.

## Learning Objectives

By completing this assignment, you will:
1. Master computing and data analysis skills
2. Practice creating a Jupyter notebook in the style of supporting information often published with a journal article
3. Create publication-quality plots
3. Plan, create, and deliver a brief talk (which is great practice for the 1st year PhD students!)

## Part 1: Revise a Numerical Methods Jupyter Notebook

Please take a few minutes to browse [previously contributed notebooks](../notebooks/contrib/contribute.md). Most students individually revise one of these notebooks.

Many of these notebooks need some minor editing:
* Ensure consistent section numbers
* Fix equations not rendered correctly
* Fix links to other notebooks
* Move all solutions, including discussion solutions, to between `### BEGIN SOLUTION` and `### END SOLUTION` in code block.
* Spelling and grammar checks
* Ensure all images render correctly

Each person will contribute their editted notebook via GitHub following [these instructions](../notebooks/contrib/contribute.md). **Important:** Do NOT edit the notebook using the "Launch Colab" link on the class website. Instead, you need to download the correct file [here](https://github.com/ndcbe/data-and-computing/tree/main/notebooks/contrib-dev). You can then upload this version to Google Colab for editting. If you do not follow these instructions, you will end the wrong version of the file and need to redo your work.

Each person also needs to make at least one substantial intellectual contribution to their assignment notebook. Ideas:
* Add a new sensitivity analysis and discussion question
* Draw a strong connection to linear algebra
* Perform regression in Python instead of Excel in [](../notebooks/contrib/McCabe-Thiele.ipynb)

Alternately, a team may decide to contribute a new notebook to the class website. This may be either a new example (hint: look to a textbook for inspiration) or an explanation of an advanced topics. Here are some advanced topics to consider:
* QR factorization
* Line search or trust regions for globalization of Newton's method
* Finite volume or finite element discretization methods
* Shooting for boundary value problems

For each topic, Prof. Dowling can provide a recommended textbook chapter to use a basis for the contributed notebook.

### Project Proposal

Each person needs to submit a project proposal 

## Part 2: Create a Data Analysis Jupyter Notebook

## Part 3: Deliver a Final Presentation

## Jupyter Notebook Formatting Guidelines
