# Statistical Inference

**Chapter Learning Objectives**
1. Draw inferences and each conclusions using data corrupted by (measurement) uncertainty
2. Choose the statistical inference technique for common science and engineering applications

**Main Idea behind Statistical Inference**

**Idea 1: How to *infer* a quantity about a population using samples?**

Example: How to estimate height of ND engineering students using our class as a sample?
* The average height in our class **approximates** or **estimates** the mean height of the student body.
* How to quantify the **uncertainty** in our estimate?

We will do this using confidence intervals **confidence intervals**.

**Idea 2: How to test a scientific or engineering *hypothesis*?**

Example: We receive a shipment of 1000 widgets and select only 10 of them to weigh. We wish to infer is the entire batch is within manufacturing specifications.

We will do this using **hypothesis testing**.

<b>Class Activity</b>: Which partner can generate the longest list of statistic inference examples? Consider inference problem you would encounter as a student, a citizen, and a practicing chemical engineer.

We will see throughout this lecture that **confidence intervals** and **hypothesis testing** have the same mathematical basis and are closely related.
