# Python Primer

## Why Python?

* Python is extremely popular for **scientific computing** and **data science**
* Python is a *high-level* language. Its syntax is more flexible and forgiving.
* Many concepts from Python translate to other languages such as Fortran, C/C++, MATLAB, etc.
* You will use Python in **CBE 30338** (Process Controls) and it is helpful for **CBE 30370** (Phase Equilibria and Separations).

**IEEE names Python as the top programming language of 2019**

## Chapter Learning Objectives

After studying this notebook, completing the activities, and asking questions in class, you should be able to:
* Write pseudocode and comments pursuant to class standards.
* Write, debug, and predict the output of 10 to 20 line Python programs that use `for`, `while`, `if`, `elif`, and `else`.
* Create and manipulate strings in Python.
* Create and iterate over lists.
* Create and use functions in Python. This includes writing a complete document string.
* Explain scope to a classmate. Predict the output of Python code that involves scope rules (similar to activity).
* Read text files into Python.

## Activities

<div class="admonition tip"> 
<p class="title"><b>Note</b></p>
The distinction between activity types is predominantly for CBE 20258 which has a more formal "flipped" or "first exposure outside the classroom" structure.
</div>

This repository contains a collection Python notebooks with embedded activities.

<div class="admonition seealso"> 
<p class="title"><b>Home Activity</b></p>
These are very short activities are designed to promote quick mastery.
</div>

For each class meeting, you will be assigned one or more notebooks to **read completely**. We recommend you also work through all of the home activities as part of the reading. We will post any **required** home activities to Vocareum.

Some activities we plan to revist during tutorial.

<div class="admonition danger"> 
<p class="title"><b>Tutorial Activity</b></p>
We will come back to this activity in tutorial.
</div>

During each lecture, we will walk through the notebook. A majority of class time will be dedicated to completing **class activities** with partners and discussing as a class. It is critical you attempt the home activties before coming to class, otherwise you may not be ready for the class activities.

<div class="admonition note"> 
<p class="title"><b>Note</b></p>
We will work on these activities with partners and then compile solutions together.
</div>

For *CBE 20258, We will use Vocareum to collect and grade almost all Python assignments this semester. We are providing most of the same activities here on this website as a resource for you in future semesters, e.g., in junior/senior lab when you need to do error propagation.
