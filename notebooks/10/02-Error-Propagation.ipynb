    "As engineers, we are rarely interested in simply characterizing the uncertainty in measurements. Instead, we often use the measurement values to perform calculations. Naturally, we want to propagate the uncertainty from the measures through to the calculation. This is known as **error propagation**. I promise you will use it in multiple laboratory classes at Notre Dame and as practicing engineers after graduation.\n",

The formulas that follow are given for two measured quantities $X$ and $Y$, but generalize to any dimensions. We assume we know the measurement uncertainties $\\sigma_X$ and $\\sigma_Y$ as well as the covariance $\\sigma_{X,Y}$. We want to estimate the uncertainty $\\sigma_Z$ for the computed quantity $Z$."
