## Course Description

Computing and data science skills are without doubt extremely valuable for modern engineers. *Big data*, *machine learning*, *predictive modeling*, *decision science* and similar terms are ever-present in job posting, scientific literature, and popular news. Yet, many chemical engineers lack a background in the fundamentals of computer programming, applied statistics, and mathematical modeling for problem solving. Your excitement for data-centric topics may lead you to self-study with tutorials, extracurricular projects, and online classes to assemble a *toolbox of skills* or *cookbook of recipes* without understanding the fundamentals that govern and transcend methods. 

In this class, you will learn the fundamentals of i) computing in Python, ii) mathematical modeling, iii) numerical methods, and iv) probability and statistics. In a single-semester, graduate-level class, it is impossible to master all of the skills in numerical and statistical techniques you will encounter during your careers. Instead, the overall goal of this class is to provide a solid technical foundation and nurture conceptual understanding. This is to both equip you with basic skills to use in future chemical engineering classes and enable you to learn advanced topics via technical electives, internships, online tutorials, books, and on-the-job training throughout your professional careers.

## Instructor and Teaching Assistants

## Slack and Email Correspondance
* Post your questions to Slack in **public channel**, no private messages to TA and instructor
* Instructor only: adowling@nd.edu, “CBE 60258” in subject, private official matters (e.g., excused absence, testing accommodations)

We encourage you to post all your questions including your mathematical models, pseudocode, and code screenshots to the **public channels**. We are doing this for a few reasons:
1. As professionals, you'll need to be comfortable asking questions in front of a team. We would like to cultivate a positive and friendly learning environment where everyone can practice this skill during the semester.
2. By answering questions in the public Slack channels, everyone in the class will have access to the same information.
3. We would like to cultivate a learning community with peer instruction; as professionals, you'll need to answer your peers' questions.

For the above-mentioned reasons, please do not send private messages in Slack.
To contact Prof. Dowling about truly private and official matters (e.g., excused absence, schedule meeting to discuss class progress), please write to adowling@nd.edu with "CBE 60258" in the email subject.

## Office Hours
* Prof. Dowling: Thursdays 8:30 – 9:25 am in 228 DeBartolo Hall
* TA: Thursdays 4:00 - 5:00 pm in 366 Nieuwland Hall

## Textbook and Reference Materials

About 40% of the class sessions map reference chapters from *Computational Nuclear Engineering and Radiological Science Using Python* by [Prof. Ryan McClarren in Aerospace and Mechanical Engineering](https://engineering.nd.edu/faculty/ryan-mcclarren/) (2019). As we will see throughout the class, many mathematical and computational techniques are widely applicable across engineering disciplines. This is only a recommended text. There are two copies on reserve in the library. We strongly recommend looking at the library copies before purchasing.

Another 40% of the class sessions draw from material in *Statistics for Engineers and Scientists* by Prof. William Navidi (2014). This is one of our favorite introductory textbooks on statistics because every concept is introduced with science and engineering examples. These worked out examples show you how to apply data analysis concepts to problems you will use as practicing engineers. The book is both mathematically rigorous and accessible. We **strongly recommend you purchase a copy to keep**. We are using the 4th edition this semester so you can purchase used books.

## Classroom Meetings

Classroom meetings are a mix of i) traditional chalk board instruction, ii) computer demonstrations, and iii) in-class activities. Please bring an internet connected laptop computer. You are expected to have completed the assigned reading and at home activities for each topic (posted on Canvas/Vocareum) before each class session. 

## Assessments and Final Grades
* Homework: 25\% (4 to 6 planned)
* Midterm Exam: 25\%
* Project 1: 25\%
* Project 2: 25\% (replaces written final exam)
