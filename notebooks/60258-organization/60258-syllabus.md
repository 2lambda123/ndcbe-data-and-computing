# Syllabus

CBE 60258, Advanced Data and Computing for Chemical Engineers, University of Notre Dame, Fall 2022

## Course Description

Computing and data science skills are without doubt extremely valuable for modern engineers. *Big data*, *machine learning*, *predictive modeling*, *decision science* and similar terms are ever-present in job posting, scientific literature, and popular news. Yet, many chemical engineers lack a background in the fundamentals of computer programming, applied statistics, and mathematical modeling for problem solving. Your excitement for data-centric topics may lead you to self-study with tutorials, extracurricular projects, and online classes to assemble a *toolbox of skills* or *cookbook of recipes* without understanding the fundamentals that govern and transcend methods. 

In this class, you will learn the fundamentals of i) computing in Python, ii) mathematical modeling, iii) numerical methods, and iv) probability and statistics. In a single-semester, graduate-level class, it is impossible to master all of the skills in numerical and statistical techniques you will encounter during your careers. Instead, the overall goal of this class is to provide a solid technical foundation and nurture conceptual understanding. This is to both equip you with basic skills to use in future chemical engineering classes and enable you to learn advanced topics via technical electives, internships, online tutorials, books, and on-the-job training throughout your professional careers.

## Slack and Email Correspondance
* Post your questions to Slack in **public channel**, no private messages to TA and instructor
* Instructor only: adowling@nd.edu, “CBE 60258” in subject, private official matters (e.g., excused absence, testing accommodations)

We encourage you to post all your questions including your mathematical models, pseudocode, and code screenshots to the **public channels**. We are doing this for a few reasons:
1. As professionals, you'll need to be comfortable asking questions in front of a team. We would like to cultivate a positive and friendly learning environment where everyone can practice this skill during the semester.
2. By answering questions in the public Slack channels, everyone in the class will have access to the same information.
3. We would like to cultivate a learning community with peer instruction; as professionals, you'll need to answer your peers' questions.

For the above-mentioned reasons, please do not send private messages in Slack.
To contact Prof. Dowling about truly private and official matters (e.g., excused absence, schedule meeting to discuss class progress), please write to adowling@nd.edu with "CBE 60258" in the email subject.

## Textbook and Reference Materials

About 40% of the class sessions map reference chapters from *Computational Nuclear Engineering and Radiological Science Using Python* by [Prof. Ryan McClarren in Aerospace and Mechanical Engineering](https://engineering.nd.edu/faculty/ryan-mcclarren/) (2019). As we will see throughout the class, many mathematical and computational techniques are widely applicable across engineering disciplines. This is only a recommended text. There are two copies on reserve in the library. We strongly recommend looking at the library copies before purchasing.

Another 40% of the class sessions draw from material in *Statistics for Engineers and Scientists* by Prof. William Navidi (2014). This is one of our favorite introductory textbooks on statistics because every concept is introduced with science and engineering examples. These worked out examples show you how to apply data analysis concepts to problems you will use as practicing engineers. The book is both mathematically rigorous and accessible. We **strongly recommend you purchase a copy to keep**. We are using the 4th edition this semester so you can purchase used books.

## Classroom Meetings

Classroom meetings are a mix of i) traditional chalk board instruction, ii) computer demonstrations, and iii) in-class activities. Please bring an internet connected laptop computer. You are expected to have completed the assigned reading and optionally home activities for each topic before each class session as indicated on the semester schedule. 

## Assessments and Final Grades
* Homework: 25\% (4 to 6 planned)
* Midterm Exam: 25\%
* Project 1: 25\%
* Project 2: 25\% (replaces written final exam)

### Homework

Problem set homework assignments are a collection of 2 to 5 problems designed to reinforce specific concepts and skills from class. Most problems include “pencil and paper” analysis (i.e., derive a model, determine degrees of freedom, write pseudocode), computer programming aspects, and interpretation of calculated results. These problems, especially the analysis and interpretation parts, are good practice for the exams. Many students receive near full credit on the problem sets.

You are permitted (and encouraged) to discuss solution approaches to the weekly homework assignments with classmates, however there is to be no wholesale copying or paraphrasing of code, solutions, or written discussions. You are encouraged to ask questions, including posting pseudocode or code screenshots, on Slack. Likewise, you may use any material posted by the instructors or your classmates in the public Slack channels. This policy is meant to facilitate collaboration while ensuring everyone in the class has the same access. Students MAY NOT use old HW files and solutions for the algorithm assignments: If you cannot do the problems for homework, you will not be able to do them on the exams either.

*As a rule of thumb, if you are not comfortable explaining your solution strategy to an instructor or TA, you should not turn in the work as your own.*

Your work may be electronically tested for plagiarized content. For example, Vocareum and Gradescope have sophisticated capabilities to detect highly similar code (i.e., plagiarism for computer code) while distinguishing from provided templates. Plagiarism is a serious offense and will result in severe consequences per University, College, and Department procedures.

### Midterm Exam

The midterm exam will take place during class as indicated on the semester schedule. The exam will be closed book with no access to a computer. Students will be permitted to bring 2 sheets of letter paper filled with handwritten notes.

### Project 1: Numerical Methods for Problem Solving

More details will be shared soon.

### Project 2: Data Analysis

More details will be shared soon.


### Grading Standards

All computer code must be commented. No exceptions.

All graphs must have labeled axes with UNITS. Likewise, all final answers need UNITS and should be rounded to the appropriate number of significant digits.

Be sure to answer the questions that are asked. When discussing results, only report the appropriate number of significant figures.

**Problem Sets:** Not all (sub)questions on problem sets will be graded in detail. You may lose points for missing comments, missing units, unlabeled graphs, and non-sensible significant figures (digits) for final answers, even for problems only graded for completion.

**Formatting**: The expectation is that your submission includes neatly written code with extensive comments, well-labeled graphs, and answers to any discussion questions. Your project submissions should be professionally formatted, like a laboratory report. Your response to discussion questions and code comments MUST be written in your own words.

**Pseudocode:** Most assignments require you to write brief pseudocode. We will learn how to do this during the first week of the semester. Your pseudocode needs to reflect all the main steps and logic of your solution. You do not need to rewrite your pseudocode if your final solution has different main steps or logic. Instead, you should update your pseudocode with a few notes showing the change. In our experience, rewriting the pseudocode is very helpful if you find a mistake in your logic but get stuck making modifications. Prof. Dowling has been programming in Python for 20 years. He writes pseudocode and so do other professional software developers.

Please see the handouts “Pseudocode Guidelines” and “Python and Commenting Guidelines” for additional information. (TODO: Translate these into .md pages.)

### Assignment Submission

Assignments should be submitted electronically via Gradescope. For Jupyter Notebooks, you will need to upload the `.ipynb` file to Gradescope. Likewise, handwritten analysis should be scanned to a PDF and submitted via Gradescope.

### Regrade Requests

Mistakes can be made during grading. Regrades to correct these mistakes will be considered for **up to ONE week after assignment grades are posted online**. 

Regrade requests must be submitted in writing via Gradescope. Please include a 1-3 sentence explanation of the grading mistake. We will not consider adjustments to the grading point distribution.

All regrade requests will result in a reevaluation of the entire assignment. For rubric selection mistakes in Gradescope, this means we will recheck all rubric selections. For more substantial requests, the grader may choose to reexamine the entire problem (including all subparts) and possibly the entire assignment.

## Software

We will use Python 3 in this class. You have three options to use Python:
1. (Recommended for Most People.) Use Google Colab. This allows you to complete all assignments from any internet accessible computer.
2. (Recommended for Advanced Users.) Install [anaconda3](https://www.anaconda.com/download/) on your own computer. This is a free distribution of Python that includes common packages for data analysis and scientific computing. You will need to install popular packages such as `numpy`, `scipy`, `pandas`, and `matplotlib`.
3. Use anaconda3 installed on any ESC maintained computer, e.g., B19 in Fitzpatrick Hall.

## Inclusiveness, Mental Health, and Disabilities

The University of Notre Dame is committed to social justice. We share that commitment and strive to maintain a positive learning environment based on open communication, mutual respect, and non-discrimination. In this class we will not discriminate on the basis of race, sex, age, economic class, disability, veteran status, religion, sexual orientation, color, or national origin. Any suggestions as to how to further such a positive and open environment will be appreciated and given serious consideration.

Diminished mental health can interfere with optimal academic performance. The source of symptoms might be related to your course work; if so, please speak with us. However, problems with other parts of your life can also contribute to decreased academic performance. The University Counseling Center (UCC) provides cost-free and confidential mental health services to help you manage personal challenges that threaten your emotional or academic well-being. Remember, getting help is a smart and courageous thing to do — for yourself and for those who care about you. For more resources please see ucc.nd.edu.
