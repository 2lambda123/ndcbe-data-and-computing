# Project 1: Computating for Problem Solving

## Introduction

In teams of two, you will develop a Python/Jupyter notebook that applies one more computing skills from CBE 60258 to solve a science or engineering example. Most teams will find it easiest to choose an example or problem from their favoriate undergraduate or graduate textbook. Alternately, teams, in consultation with the instructor, may develop a notebook targetted at younger learns (e.g., K-12), for use in STEM ourreach activities. Likewise, teams may solve an example or homework problem from another CBE graduate class with the written permission of that instructor. (Some faculty may not want examples or homework problems disseminated outside their class.)

The expectation is that all notebooks will be contributed to this website, thereby creating a repository of examples. Students are encouraged to use these examples as reference material, especially during their duties as graduate teaching assistants. Mini-project 1 (simulating games of chance) is a good example format. Each notebook should build up the solution in parts with discussion questions. Solutions should be marked starting with the comment `### BEGIN SOLUTIONS` and ending with the comment `### END SOLUTIONS`.

## Learning Objectives

By completing this assignment, you will:
1. Master computing skills for (chemical) engineering problem solving
2. Develop educational materials including writing learning objectives, discussion questions, and solutions
3. Practice modified version of the peer review process

## Project Proposal

Each team should submit a project proposal 1 to 3 pages in length that contains the following elements:
1. States the problem to be solved. For example, typeset the textbook example or problem and incldue the appropriate reference.
2. Identifies the computing skills from CBE 60258 that will be incorporated into the notebook.
3. Briefly desribes possible discussion/critical thinking questions to pose during the notebook. All projects should not end at making a plot or computing an answer; they must include discussion questions to prompt critical thinking about the results.
4. Briefly describe "pencil and paper" analysis readers will need to perform such as deriving a model, check degrees of freedom, or writing pseudocode. Each notebook should include at least one "pencil and paper" step or section.
5. Provide a short outline for the notebook, e.g., section and subsection titles.

Tips:
* Shorter is better.
* Use headers and subheaders to break the notebook into sections (similar to mini-project 1 and other homework projects).

## Project Notebook

This is the main deliverable for the project.

### Examples and Length

Here are some example notebooks which are former Mini-Project Homeworks for CBE 20258:
* Mini-Project 1 (simulating games of chance)
* Inertia navigation
* Adsorptive membrane case study

Your example notebook should be suitable for a 20 to 30-minute class activity or 20 to 120-minute homework problem for an undergraduate or first-year graduate student. For context, the above examples are approximately 1.5 to 3 times longer than needed for this project. Similarly, you should target 20% to 60% of the length of mini-project 1 (simulating games of change).
