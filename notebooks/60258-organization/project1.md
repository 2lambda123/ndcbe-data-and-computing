# Project 1: Computating for Problem Solving

## Introduction

In teams of two (or three if there is an odd number of students in the class), you will develop a Python/Jupyter notebook that applies one more computing skills from CBE 60258 to solve a science or engineering example. Most teams will find it easiest to choose an example or problem from their favoriate undergraduate or graduate textbook. Alternately, teams, in consultation with the instructor, may develop a notebook targetted at younger learns (e.g., K-12), for use in STEM ourreach activities.

The expectation is that all notebooks will be contributed to this website, thereby creating a repository of examples. Students are encouraged to use these examples as reference material, especially during their duties as graduate teaching assistants.

Here are some example notebooks:

## Learning Objectives

By completing this assignment, you will:
1. Master computing skills for (chemical) engineering problem solving
2. Develop educational materials including writing learning objectives, discussion questions, and solution
3. Practice modified version of the peer review process

## Project Proposal

Each team should submit a project proposal 1 to 3 pages in length that contains the following elements:
1. States the problem to be solved. For example, typeset the textbook example or problem and incldue the appropriate reference.
2. Identifies the computing skills from CBE 60258 that will be incorporated into the notebook.
3. Briefly desribes possible discussion/critical thinking questions to pose during the notebook. All projects should not end at making a plot or computing an answer; they must include discussion questions to prompt critical thinking about the results.
4. Briefly describe "pencil and paper" analysis readers will need to perform such as deriving a model, check degrees of freedom, write pseudocode, etc. Each notebook should include at least one "pencil and paper" step or section.
5. Provide a short outline for the notebook, e.g., section and subsection titles.

Tips:
* Shorter is better. 
* Use headers or bold font to make it easy to find the requested information.
