    "The items in a sample are **independent** if knowing the values of some of the items does not help to predict the values of the others. Because tangible populations are finite, samples taken without replacement are not strictly independent. For example, if we choose student \"John Doe\" to keep a food journal, we know that \"John Doe\" will not be chosen again (assuming everyone has a unique name and we are sampling without replacement). But we often treat simple random samples as independent if the sample contains less than 5% of the population."
