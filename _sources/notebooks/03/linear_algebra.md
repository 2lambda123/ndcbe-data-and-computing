# Linear Algebra Primer

This chapter is targeted at graduate students in **CBE 60258** who have not formally studied linear algebra. All students enrolled in **CBE 20258** should have already completed or be concurrently enrolled in an undergraduate linear algebra class and can skip this chapter. 

We focus on the main ideas of the first six chapters of No Bullshit Guide to Linear Algebra by Ivan Savov (2020). The first chapter also serves as an introduction to programming in Python.

**Chapter Learning Objectives**
1. Review key linear algebra properties and decomposition methods
